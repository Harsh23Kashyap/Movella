The second question is :-

2.File Parsing
A webserver log file contains multiple log entries of various activities. Each log entry is begins with
either
INFO, DEBUG or ERROR. Write a program that accepts a log file and writes 3 different log files - one
for each type of log entry ( i.e. INFO log, DEBUG log and ERROR logs) containing those relevant type
of log entries.

I have done it on Jupyter notebook. You can simply run it on Google colab or Jupyter notebook. It will give you the desired result.
I have created a sample csv file named LogFile.csv (attached in the repository). It contains:-
1. Serial No.
2. Time
3. Log
You can run python script by downloading that file as well. I have segredated all the three type of log into different file along with date as csv files namely:-
1. Debug.csv
2. Error.csv
3. Info.csv

I hope you find it worth your time.
